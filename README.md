# MRCP utilities of Optimal City Technologies
The crate contains some utilities for integration of ASR and TTS services into UniMRCP server.

## Build
Before you start make sure that UniMRCP lib installed on your system along with its dependencies. Also environment variables `UNIMRCP_PATH`, `APR_LIB_PATH`, `APR_INCLUDE_PATH` should contain paths to them. Otherwise build script will use default paths, see source code.
